Title: Project Status Report 

Goal: 
1) Outline what was accomplished this week
2) Address challenges/issues faced this week 
3) Goals for next week 


1) This past week we started to lay the groundwork for our compatiblity app. 
We started by initializing our google maps userface using Google's API. We also 
started to put together possible questions to ask the user so that we could 
acquire data for our compatibility algorithm. Finally, we added some simple css
code to begin designing our website to resemble the mock up we made for our proposal.

2) One of our biggest challenges during the week was finding times that everyone could 
meet. As this was a heavy week in terms of exams, it was very hard for anyone to find 
time to devote to the project. Another difficulty we had was determining what path we wanted to go down in terms of creating our compatibility algorithm. We're having a difficult time 
deciding whether we want to create an algorithm to determine major compatibility or a 
prospective students fit at Tufts. 

3) Our goals for next week are to create a schedule using google docs so that everyone
knows what their job is, to start to create checkpoints on the google maps interface as 
well as make a final group decision on the desired direction for the compatibility 
algorithm. Another major goal is to start creating and hitting deadlines instead of 
waiting until the last minute. To really get this project moving in the right direction,
we will need to be more disciplined in terms of prioritizing these goals.

I would do a 3 question survey to start.  Maybe this is a good start? https://www.buzzfeed.com/mattbellassai/what-should-your-college-major-actually-be?utm_term=.ovay0DqpG#.cywYmdVZ3
