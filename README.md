-Project Title: TPSA (Tufts Prospective Student App )
 
-Problem Statement: 
	*Prospective students don’t know what Tufts is really like beyond what they see on tours and in admissions, so how can they tell if Tufts is really right for them?

-Solution: 
	*We want prospective students that are touring Tufts campus to have a greater understanding of whether or not Tufts is the right university for them. 
	*While the Tufts administration provides general campus tours that show prospects the basics that Tufts has to offer, we plan to design an interface that highlights POI’s (Points of Interest) with honest data from real Tufts students. 
	*We also wish to provide these prospective students with the ability to enter their own personal information and see in real time how it stacks up to previously accepted students.
 
-Features: 
	*An interactive homepage with links to google maps interface and quiz-type submission page
	*Google Maps interface with POIs marked with detailed information about each location
	*A quiz-type submission page for compatibility test -- users put in personal data such as GPA, standardized test scores, extracurriculars and receive notification via  email or text their results.
	*For this project we will be utilizing Google Maps and Twilio APIs and will also be using Node.js to handle the server side framework.

-What data will your prototype be using and collecting: 
	*Prototype uses the user’s gps location. We need to collect information about POIs on Tufts campus, and users can submit GPA etc to get back compatibility results.

-Special techniques / algorithms:
	*compatibility algorithm for seeing if Tufts is right for you (some sort of similarity rating comparing them to “the average student”?)
