Title: Project Status Report 3 

Goal:

Outline what was accomplished this week

Address challenges/issues faced this week

Goals for next week

1. This week Bootstrap was used in order to create the home 
page as well as the quiz home page. Right now both pages 
work for any browser size exccluding mobile devices. it was 
decided that there will be a home quiz page with links to 
specific quiz pages. The user will have to complete all quizzes 
in order to submit their results for a score. 

2. Challenges that were faced this week were getting the 
site to display correctly on mobile devices. This will take 
some more time but shouldnt be too difficult using Bootstrap. 
Another challenge was also getting everyone together to work 
on the project. 

3. Goals for next week are to start working on the google interface,
namely creating the locations and popup windows that will lead to 
quiz sites. As for the rest of the front end development, the 
google interface and individual quiz pages are all thats left. 
After these are created, which shouldn't take too long, the rest 
of the project will involve back end dev.
