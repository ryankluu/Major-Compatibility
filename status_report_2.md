Title: Project Status Report 2 

Goal:

Outline what was accomplished this week

Address challenges/issues faced this week

Goals for next week

1. This past week our group met together twice to finalize how we plan to move 
forward with the compatibility aspect of our project. After a few hours of 
deliberation we were able to pull together a clear and cohesive image of the 
route we wanted to pursue. We decided that we will provide land marks using 
the Google maps API that the user can click on to reveal pop up windows containing 
a link. Each link will redirect them to a separate page where there will be 
several questions for them to answer in a Buzz-feed like style. After all questions
from each location have been answered, we will provide the top 3 majors that they 
matched with based on their answers. 
	- Specifics: 
		- Users have to answer all questions before receiving a response 
		- Users do not have to physically go to each location in order 
			to take part in the quiz for that location 

2. This week our main challenge was just deciding on a route that we all could agreed on. 
Everyone put up good points for why we should or should not pursue certain aspects 
of the compatibility app. We are glad though that we took the time to sit down and 
specifically outline what we wanted instead of starting to code and work on something 
that would eventually get scrapped. Another challenge we are facing involves the server 
side aspect of the project. We are not completely sure how we plan to incorportate a 
server side framework but will address that obstacle when we get to it. 

3. Moving into next week we plan to start implementing the pre-outlined aspects of our project. 
Now that we have a clear vision of what we want the app to be, it should be much easier to 
start bringing thoughts and ideas to life.
